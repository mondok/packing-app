# Packing App 
This is just a quick Angular application I put together that maintains a list of packing supplies and then gives you the ability to print them.  In terms of what's built in, some things to look at are:

* Using Angular's .Value to share data between controllers
* Routing
* The [ng-group](https://github.com/samstokes/ng-group) filter that's used in the print screen
